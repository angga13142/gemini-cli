# Data Processing Components

This directory contains data processing components for the Gemini CLI backend.

## Components to Move Here (from packages/core/src/core/):

Currently, most data processing logic is embedded in API components or UI
components. Components to extract and move here:

- Response parsing logic (currently in geminiChat.ts)
- Data transformation utilities (to be extracted from UI components)

## Status

This directory is prepared for future data processing components that will be
extracted from UI components during Phase 3.2 (Logic Extraction).

## Note

Data processing logic will be extracted from UI components in Phase 3.2, then
organized here.
